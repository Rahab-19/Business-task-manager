Got it. Here’s a clean and easy-to-copy **README.md** draft for your project:

# Task Manager System

This is a simple Python-based task management system.  
It allows users to register, log in, assign tasks, track progress, and generate reports.  
The system includes admin-specific features such as deleting tasks, generating reports, and viewing statistics.

---

## Features

### General Users
- Login with username and password  
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- View tasks assigned to them  

### Admin Users
- Register new users  
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- View tasks assigned to them  
- View completed tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Generate reports  
- Display overall statistics  

---

## File Structure
- `task_manager.py` → Main Python script containing the system  
- `user.txt` → Stores registered users and passwords  
- `tasks.txt` → Stores all task records  
- `task_overview.txt` → Report with task statistics  
- `user_overview.txt` → Report with user statistics  

---

## Task Format
Each task in `tasks.txt` is stored as:

```

username, task_title, task_description, date_assigned, due_date, completed

```

Example:
```

john, Update Inventory, Update the bookstore stock list, 2025-09-30, 2025-10-07, No

## Skills Demonstrated

* Python programming
* File handling (read/write)
* User authentication system
* Role-based access control (Admin vs User)
* Date handling with `datetime`
* Report generation and statistics

---

## Future Improvements

* Store passwords securely with hashing
* Add search and filter functions for tasks
* Use SQLite or another database for scalability
* Export reports to CSV for easier analysis
* Improve task display formatting

Do you want me to also make a **shorter version** (1–2 paragraphs) for your GitHub repo description, or just keep this detailed README?
